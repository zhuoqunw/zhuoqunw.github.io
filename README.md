This project is from SI649 Info Visualization Fall 2020 at the University of Michigan. Using info visualization tools, I was trying to explore what matters to a country's success at the winter Olympics. I discussed several possible reasons, including GDP and population, Human Development Index, GDP per capita, Gini coefficient and multiple-medal-winning athletes. From my visualizations, I found that:
* There is a positive relationship between GDP per capita and number of medals, indicating the richer the country is, more medals it would win.
* There is a positive relationship between HDI and number of medals. More developed a country is, more medals it would win. 
* There is no significant relationship between national power (evaluated by GDP and population) and number of medals. 
* Income inequality (Gini coefficient) is also not related to the number of medals. 
* Multiple-medal-winning athletes are important to their countries's success. 

Since it is an interactive design, there is much more to explore with the visualizations! Don't hesitate to discover interesting insights by yourself at zhuoqunw.github.io!
